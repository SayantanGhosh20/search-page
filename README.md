# search-page

this is a simple search page made with HTML and CSS. the back ground has been taken from google image search and the rest of the code is done by me from scratch.
in the HTML file i have used a form instead of div tag to wrap up all the input fields and buttons. inside the form tag the rest of the elements are put into div tags
to put the input and button fields in different lines. the fas fa-user and fas fa-lock are used to put the icons in the input fields. these fonts are taken from font awesome 
which has been imported in the CSS file.
in the CSS file i have first set up the overall properties of the page inside the body element selector, since no font has been included thus the default font set of 'serif' have
been set in the page. the top , left and transform attributes have been used to position the contents of the form tag. note that the color of the website is set in hex code format 
and there is a combination of relative and absolute units to make the webpage reasonably responsive while giving the form elements a certain fixed size for comfortable use.
